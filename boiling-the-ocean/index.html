# CLI - _why do I care_? 
Harold Vilander

???
Revisiting this
did it for FE chapter a while ago
Having a chat with a more jr. 
mentioned it would be nice to have some tips tricks and basics

ADAM: what can you do in vim you cannot do in vscode
some keyboard things I find myself using in vscode

# The case for CLI skills
<div style={{paddingTop: "64px"}}>
  <img src="assets/knife.png" alt="knife" height="200px"/>
  <img src="assets/commerical.png" alt="onion" height="200px"/>
</div>

???
one will chop all the onions, but sometimes maybe you don't want the dice
maybe you need slices, and yes you could get a mandolin 

the only way to have cli skills is to practice them

PICK THE BEST TOOL FOR YOU.

# 1. Not exhaustive
# 2. probably full of errors 
# 3. zsh / bash 
# 4. target audience 

???
ALMOST certain better ways, this is a fast for me

zsh default with macOS 
bash should all be the same

Audience - zsh / bash users, new devs, some cli tips and tricks seekers.
Good luck windows fools, get a posix system

trying to be enough different for those that saw the FE talk
If you want I can get you a link to that recording.

# Downsides 
- easy to over config
- I am a broken purist and a curmudgeon


???
A lot of this, if you are thinking "I already do this faster"
then ignore it. PICK THE BEST TOOL FOR YOU.

# END OF DISCLAIMERS

# If you only get one thing from this, this might be the most useful.
```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

# Tab completion

# Using the Shell
- what directory is this? 
- moving around 
- what is in this dir? 
- what size are these things
- getting help
- being super
- do it again
- do it again but super

???
```bash
BE IN ~/dec16_talk

pwd
ls
cd react-express-example 
cd ..

cd ~/dev/talks/cli-basics 
cd -

ls
man 
moving around a bit

sudo

UP ARROW

sudo !!

```

# killing things, background, foreground 

`ctrl c` : SIGINT / kill
`ctrl z` : pause the fg -> fg and bg

???
start a ping
ctrl c

start a npm server
ctrl z
bg 
jobs
fg
kill

---

# pipe and connecting commands

- less is more
- &&

???
&& example - rm -rf node_modules && npm ci && npm run dev

# node REPL

???
 Read Evaluate Print Loop

 const a = [1,2,3]
 a.filter(e => e > 1)



---

# some config
`~/.zshrc` alias

```
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

???

- I recommend keeping your config files in a repository and soft link them
- my g as git is from .oh-my-zsh/plugins/git... maybe where I have gone too far

---


# VS Code
- go to file fuzzy: `cmd p`
- go to definition: `cmd b`
- find references: `shift F12`
- go to line:  `ctrl g`
- go to next occurrence: `cmd d`

???
ActionsModal.tsx
