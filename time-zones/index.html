# Time Zones
by Harold Vilander

**TODO make xample in SQFORM branch: time-zone-example**

???
Intro:
Hello!!!
- Computerphile: mostly a cautionary tale about time math in general
- we are not out in the wilderness and have some tools that we can use
1. Some more detailed background and terms that we may normally have
2. Some application of those terms with an example
3. Demo of issue an resolution

# Observed vs. Incremental
<img src="./assets/solar-noon.jpeg" alt="solar noon" width="333px"/>
<H1 id="EpochTime">1641828909</H1>


???
- Observed Time:  also called local time the sun is directly over head -> it is noon
- Incremental Time: computationally easier. UTC is an example. An integer
  value that increase monotonically from a specific type or Epoch.

# Field-Based Time Formats
Dates and time are divided into fields

<img src="./assets/field-based-time.png" alt="Field Based Time" width="800px"/>
e.g. ISO-8601


---



ISO-8601: 
timezone: 
time offset: 
daylight savings time:
leap seconds:

# SQ Specific

---

DB timezone setting

---

# SQFormDatePicker
- is Moment&trade; ... Moment is deprecated.
- `.isUTC()` -> false 
- `.utcOffset()` -> -300

See [Parsing][2]

IF the BE parses this as a UTC -5 / -6 time it 
could save wrong

The FE will try to show this in local time.

-- UTC IN THE MIDDLE SO SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME DATE


---

The type of data we operate on (dates vs date times)

browser settings

---  

conversion breaking things

# Tools
dev tools - 
libraries that can help
dateFns - needs an extra lib I think
moment - don't just don't
