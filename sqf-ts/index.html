if you run into them...
- Type error: Duplicate identifier 'LibraryManagedAttributes'.

# Setup 
1. Update package.json to sqforms >= 8.0.0
2. Likely update your scplus-shared-components
3. If TS project, remove the catch
all type declaration
4. * version of react !!
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24304#issuecomment-1094565891 

`declare module '@selectquotelabs/sqform';`

???
A note about 'dedup'ing
- sean should have this fixed
- SC+ 7.9.0 or greater
- my last talk went over some
headaches that i had with this
- src/external/nextjs/types/sqform.d.ts

# #1
- validation schema `yup.object` *
- typing choices:  
  - formikBag vs formikHelpers
  - onChange handlers
