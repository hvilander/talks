# MERGED !!!!!!

I was gonna sell ya'll TS

class: middle

# For today
- Assembly / Install Issues
- Consuming Breaking Changes
- Process Demo


???
While I do want to share some experiences 
I mainly want to give something useful to the 
viewer

- Assembly / Install Issues
- CSS Issues
- Consuming Breaking Changes
- Type errors on `npm run build`

---


# Getting Started
1. Update package.json to sqforms >= 8.0.0
2. Likely update your scplus-shared-components
3. If TS project, remove the catch
all type declaration

`declare module '@selectquotelabs/sqform';`

???
A note about 'dedup'ing
- sean should have this fixed
- SC+ 7.9.0 or greater
- my last talk went over some
headaches that i had with this
- src/external/nextjs/types/sqform.d.ts

# Consuming Breaking Changes

---
 
# #1
- validation schema `yup.object` *
- typing choices:  
  - formikBag vs formikHelpers
  - onChange handlers

---

# Dropdowns
- dropdown option types 
- boolean valued dropdowns

---

# Form Value Types
- context generic
- match initial values and submit handler
