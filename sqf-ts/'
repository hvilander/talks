# ISSUE 244 

???
- Goodmorning
- TS SQF _consumption_

---

class: center, middle

# I hope...

---

class: center, middle

# ~~I hope...~~
# MERGED !!!!!!

---


# Why:

1. Type errors that will help prevent bugs
2. Refactoring
3. Code completion
4. Discoverability: docs on props

---

class: center, middle

# Demo - DX 

???
Demo benefits

---

# Useful Stuff
- Assembly / Install Issues
- Consuming Breaking Changes
- Type errors on `npm run build`
- CSS issues


???
While I do want to share some experiences 
I mainly want to give something useful to the 
viewer

- Assembly / Install Issues
- CSS Issues
- Consuming Breaking Changes
- Type errors on `npm run build`

---


# Getting Started
1. Update package.json to sqforms >= 8.0.0
2. Likely update your scplus-shared-components
3. If TS project you will need to remove the catch
all type declaration
`declare module '@selectquotelabs/sqform';`

???
A note about 'dedup'ing
- sean should have this fixed
- SC+ 7.9.0 or greater
- my last talk went over some
headaches that i had with this
- src/external/nextjs/types/sqform.d.ts 

---

# Consuming Breaking Changes
- validation schema `yup.object`
- boolean valued dropdowns
- dropdown option types 
- 

???
- schema.fields -> schema

---



- set up
- common 'tasks'
- common errors
- some sc+ considerations
- some process demos

???
setup:
- type declaration
- dependency versions - I think sean likely has this resolved
- for me local consumption 

common tasks: 
 - boolean dropdowns
 - provide SQFormContext a generic type
 - yup.object (schema.fields) 

common 'errors':
 - initial values and onSave mismtach

sc+
- all of my css issues
- table spacing: on the consumer 

---


# Common type errors 
- initial value and onSave handler mismatch
- initial value and model mismatch
---

# SC+ breaking changes
- no more default padding on last child
- headers on SQFormScrollableCard and SQFormScrollableCardsMenuWrapper
... now have h5 headers and a fixed height of 50px
