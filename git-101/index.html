2. What is git?
3. How does it work (Mental Model)
4. Basic commands 
5. demos
6. working with remote repos
7. more demos
8. Q&A / Open Discussion / talk about labs

---

# Tools
- "Servers": bitbucket, github
- "clients": git cli, git lens, many more
- text editors: vscode, sublime, vim, many more
- Stop me if I shortcut!!

???
WARN THEM DON'T USE VIM

My muscle memory and my setup... I have some shortcuts
if I do something that doesn't make sense or is too
fast stop me. I don't wanna lose you!!

STOP: does this all make sense? 


---

# What is git:
- source / version control system
  - history
  - collaboration
- overwhelming market share 
- distributed
- it is NOT git hub!!
- Directed Acyclic Graph

---

# Directed Acyclic Graph

![directed graph][4]

???
- Graph
  - nodes
  - edges: directed
- no cycles

---
class: center middle

# Let's draw some pictures


???
- time
- init project
- update read me
- add feature 1
- add feature 2
- add feature 3
- break up time
- time only flows in one way! 
- this is our directed graph!! 


---

# vocabulary 
- commit
- branch
- head

???

- a commit is a change that has been added to the history
it has an identifier that is extermely close to unique
- branch is a thing that points to a commit 
- HEAD is where you are now


---
# Basic commands
- checkout
- add
- commit
- reset
- status
- log
- diff
- stash

???

- checkout moves the head to the specified destination usually a commit
- add: stages the changes
- commit: puts the staged changes on the commit history
- reset: throw away some changes

---

# Demo 1 basics

???
- mkdir demo
- git init
- git log
- git status
- git checkout -b X-1-readme-update
- vi readme.md
  - Add some text to readme

- git status
- Talk about what the status means

- git add readme.md
- git status
  - Point out staged and how to unstage

- git commit 


---


# Demo 1 basics

???
- Talk about text editors
- save and close the file
- git status
- git log
  - Go through each piece of the log



---


# Merge demo
![example][7]

???
- Walk through  the image
- merge abc into develop
- talk / show the result in log, ? update image 
- ask for prediction of merge xyz into develop
- merge xyz
- open log
  - talk about what it did
    - common ancestor & time
  - !! COMMIT MESSAGE NAMING POINT !!


---
# Local vs. Remote
- clone
- fetch
- push 
- pull 

???
clone a complete copy
fetch - updates your local with remote's objects and refs
push update remote refs along with assoc. objects
pull fetch and integrate changes from another repo or local branch

---
class: center, middle

# working _remotely_ demo

???
- open github https://github.com/hvilander/sq-git-example 
- open merge demo - make note of the changes from the merge demo 
- open local v remote demo & clone
- show that the l-v-r doesn't know about the changes on merge demo
  - i.e. it sill looks like our diagram in the slide
- push the changes from merge demo
- fetch the changes in l-v-r 
- talk about the dangers of stale branches

---


# rebasing
- HISTORY ALTERING IS DANGEROUS
- can be used to clean up some things
  - before PR squashing (I mean fixup)

---

# rebase demo
- change what feature 4 is "based on"
- "squash" changes from feature 4 before PR
- "reword" commit messages
![example][7]

---

# Opinions 
- 1 commit on top of your target at the start of your PR
- commit changes during PR WITH TICKET NUMBER 

---

# Conflicts
- when files have different changes
- merge or rebase
- can get really messy

???
- first couple have someone help you out

---
class: center, middle

# Conflict demo

???
- make a conflicted file 
- try to merge a conflict
- git status
- show the conflicts in vs code
- fix the conflict
