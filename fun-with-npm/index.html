# RoadMap

I: Some Review - install commands

II: More Review - some differences in dependency classifications 

III: an interesting problem I ran into

IV: package-lock

???
I: I will cover some basics with some details that I had lost to time
  - local package testing: docker and non docker
II: Some definitions and best practices
III: An issue I ran across 
IV: package-lock and how not to use it

Part 1: Some NPM install commmand review

- `npm install` with no arguments:
  - Installs whatever you have in package.json into the node_modules directory.
  - will not update package-lock.json
- `npm install <pkg name>`:
  - by default this is like a `--save-prod` or `-P` so... 
  - it will update your package.json
  - it will also update your package-lock.json
- `npm install <name>@<version>`
  - installs your the named package with the version provided (there are several ways
  to specify version, check the docs)
- `npm install <name> --save-dev` or `npm install <name> -D`
    - puts an entry in devdependencies 
    - update package-lock.json
- `npm ci` continuous integrations mode, installs what you have in package.json

Part 1: The issue
- Working on testing out the TS branch of SQForm
- The issue

Part 2: trouble shooting
- some trouble shooting that might be useful
- css out of order
- css duplicated!!! 

Part 3: solution hunting
- local consumption
- I no longer trust NPM with its lock
- peer dependencies?

tools 

- cli: you know I like this one
- grep ftw
`grep version node-modules/my-module/package.json`
`npm list mymodule`
`npm pack`
`npm run build`


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies

dependency vs peer vs dev dependencies

- dependencies: packages required by your application in production
- dev: packages only needed for local development
- peer: only used for packages that are released on npm. 
  a) you expect your consumers to also ahve that package a dependency
  b) you need a specific verions of that package
  and
  c) your npm package would break when the importing project has a dependency
  for another version


  npm ci

  semver:  Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
  1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
  3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

??? intro text 
I have been having some fun doing some version updates, trying to consume typescript branch of 
sqforms inside of miav. 

I had a fun error to figure out. 

I have found local consumption of our libs very useful

npm tools:
- list
- peer dependencies
- doing update installs: nuke the lock 
- maybe a better way: recomended useage


`npm install` no arguments:
- install the dependencies to the local node_moduels folder.
- looks to the dependencies listed in package.json

`-g` flag: global
installs the current package context (ie the current working dir) as
a global package

`global package`  



ooh interesting
npm install <alias>@npm<name> - installs a package under a cumtom alias
npm install [<@scope/]<name>@<version>

global

Default: false
Type: Boolean
Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the prefix folder instead of the current working directory. See folders for more on the differences in behavior.

packages are installed into the {prefix}/lib/node_modules folder, instead of the current working directory.
bin files are linked to {prefix}/bin
man pages are linked to {prefix}/share/man
