# NPM Cannot be trusted with it is lock 
 by Harold Vilander

???
Part 1: The issue
- Working on testing out the TS branch of SQForm
- The issue

Part 2: trouble shooting
- some trouble shooting that might be useful
- css out of order
- css duplicated!!! 

Part 3: solution hunting
- local consumption
- I no longer trust NPM with its lock
- peer dependencies?


---



tools 

- cli: you know I like this one
- grep ftw
`grep version node-modules/my-module/package.json`
`npm list mymodule`
`npm pack`
`npm run build`

peer vs dependencies

https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies



Scratch notes for content:


I have been having some fun doing some version updates, trying to consume typescript branch of 
sqforms inside of miav. 


I had a fun error to figure out. 

I have found local consumption of our libs very useful

npm tools:
- list
- peer dependencies
- doing update installs: nuke the lock 
- maybe a better way: recomended useage
