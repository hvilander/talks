- Two Files

- Install Commands

- Dependency "Types" 

- Some Tools

- A Recent Issue 


???
- the two files that define our dependencies
- a review of the install commands
- a review of dependency types
- some tools for understanding what is happening / trouble shooting


- A lot of this will be review, but things I had forgot
- local package testing: how to put something like sqform into your team project  
  - docker and non-docker setups
-  An interesting issue I ran across, that had no errors but the resulting CSS was
  wonky

---
# Two files
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

???
- package.json defines your dependencies and lots of other things about your project
- package-lock describes the exact versions installed
  - "A manifestation of the manifest" [10]
  - generated when npm modifies `node_modules` or package.json
  - a way to get a reproducible build with the nature of continuous deployments

---

- `npm install`
  - `package.json` -> node_modules/
  - will update package-lock.json conditionally

- `npm install <pkg name>`
  - `--save-prod` or `-P`
  - will update your package.json
  - will also update your package-lock.json

???
- with no arguments
  - condition: if the package.json was newer version than the lock
- install package name: 
 - default to --save-prod, updates package.json FOR YOU AND lock file
---

- `npm install <name>@<version>`
- `npm install <name> --save-dev` or `npm install <name> -D`
    - puts an entry in devDependencies 
- `npm ci`
???
- installs specific version (or version range, `^`) see the docs for more info
- updates the devDependencies section of package.json, will also update the package lock
- CI is continuous integration mode. 
 - meant for automated environments
 - "OR any situation where you want to make sure you have a clean install of deps"
 - if package.json and package-lock.json don't agree it will not update package-lock
 - KEY DIFFERENCE ^^^ I expected to work when manually updating package.json
 - will remove node modules if they are present.

---


# AND MORE! 
- global -> npx
- github, tar file, folder path, etc

???

- global:  using packages on your computer, docs[8] say use npx instead if 5.2 or greater
- can install from file, path, github, bitbucket, and lots of other options [4]
  - git repo installs should be a method of last resort like just testing 
  - in previous work we relied on this and it was very problematic.
  -  npm install alias@npm name - installs a package under a custom alias


---

# Dependency "Types"
- `dependencies`
- `devDependencies`
- `peerDependencies`

???
- dependencies
  - npm install from a dir that has a package.json
  - npm install $package etc
- devDependencies
 - also installed from package.json unless you `--production` 
 - not installed for npm install package unless you flag --dev
 - not installed transitively A -> B -> C
- peerDependencies
  - express compatibility with a lib while not necessarily requiring it
  - this is also called a plug in
  - this changes in v7,
  - we are on v6 ...after v7 peers should install automatically
  - unless there is a conflict that cannot auto resolve

---

# More Types

- `bundledDependencies`
- `optionalDependencies`


???

Last two we don't really use
- bundled [7] - new to me, There is a link to a Stack OF...
  use when private npm package, you don't want to create your own npm repository
  but want some of the benefits of npm packages
- optional: npm should continue with the install, generally for packages that
  don't work in every environment

---
 
# Tools 

- `npm list my-module`
- local package consumption:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm pack`

???
- more on local package testing [11] sean's talk 

---

# The Issue
- background
- confusingly, lets talk about CSS!

???
- SC3 admin, the artist formerly ... miav
- needing to update sqform, might as well go for TS
- SIDE NOTE TS IN SQFORM ROCKS!!!!

---

# DEMO: talk about the setup
- build a tarball
- edit package.json
- rm -rf node_modules
- npm install

show that package-lock.json is updated

---

# DEMO: show the broken things
- side menu works and lay out is correct
- click on a role

---

# DEMO: Go into the css and show some fun there
- First I thought it was out of order
- NOPE duplicated

---

# Demo
npm list

??? 

THIS IS THE ISSUE

---

How to resolve this
1. you may need to get the verions to match
2. package-lock changes may not be the thing you need
- nuke package-lock
