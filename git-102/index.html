# Round Two Let's Level Set

???
- This is the second time I have done one of these talks
- the last group had very limited / no exposure to git
- I snooped on some of your public repos and I don't think
  this group is in the same boat. 
- That being said, open offer if you need any level of git help
  I am happy to show you the ropes or try to help clean up a real
  mess using the reflog

# Road Map
1. start with just a touch of theory
2. fly past some basics
3. talk about common SQ curveballs
4. finish with some tips and some cli fun

# Theory - in pictures!!


???
Let's draw! 

- directed acyclic graph
  - git organizes it history this way
  - commits are nodes
  - identifiers based on sha hashes
  - nodes have descendants  
  - no cycles
  - refs: branch, tag, head

- Distributed
  - your local repository and remote are clones of
    each other that can diverge


---
# The Basics
- checkout
- add (staging)
- commit
- status
- diff
- log
- push 
- pull
- fetch
- clone

# demo log, status, reflog 
## merge

# Common things 
1. Branching strategies 
2. I started work 'branched' off of develop but it needs to be off of release
3. Prepping a PR 
4. Business changed their mind and only want one commit from develop 
5. I named my branch something silly and want to fix it
6. I made an error in my last commit message and need to fix that


???
1. Branching strategies 
- feature branches vs. develop -> release -> master /main
2. I started work 'branched' off of develop but it needs to be off of release
- rebase
3. Prepping a PR - lots of messy looking commits
- squash vs fixup
4. Business changed their mind and only want one commit from develop 
- cherry pick
5. I named my branch something silly and want to fix it
- branch rename with branch -m
6. I made an error in my last commit message and need to fix that
- git commit --amend -m "my great message"

WARN THEM DON'T USE VIM

My muscle memory and my setup... I have some shortcuts
if I do something that doesn't make sense or is too
fast stop me. I don't wanna lose you!!

STOP: does this all make sense?

Demos: log - merge - abort
???
- This is sc2-srx
- git log
- git log --no-merges (shows it simple to highlight bad commit messages
- start a bad merge
- git status
- show some conflicts
- git add 
- git status
- resolve a conflict on cli and in vscode
- abort a merge

---

class: center, middle
Demos: rebase - commands -  abort
???
- SETUP lets make some branches to make this simple
- git checkout -b branchName
- start a rebase with interactive
- NOTE YOU CAN TOTALLY DO THE TEXT EDITING IN VSCODE - I have a config command for that
- talk about the different commands
- rename a commit
- squash some commits
- fixup some commits
- g status TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE

class: center, middle
Demos: rebase - commands -  abort
???
- detached head

class: center, middle
Demos: cherry pick 
???
- pull on or more specific commits into your branch
 from another branch

- will create a new commit with the changes with new commits
