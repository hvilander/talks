# CLI - _why do I care_? 
 by Harold Vilander

???
I found this topic in the backlog, and I love the CLI.

So I thought it was a good one for me to pick up.
I also recognize that not every one needs, wants or cares about CLI skils

# 1. Not exhaustive
# 2. Correct me!
# 3. zsh / bash 

???
1. duh
2. I am very happy to learn from everyone
3. target: 

zsh starting with macOS catalina
most commands are the same
I dont think I am messing up bash users

---

# What? 

- Modivation 
- Getting around using the terminal
- Process management
- git

???
- WHY?
1. make an argument for the CLI
  a. for me, better understanding 
  b. 
- Make an argument for learning more CLI
- by More, I expect that everyone knows a bit to a lot
- I expect a lot of difference in familiarity so
 for give me covering the basics


---
# CL-WHY
1. _FOR ME_ it builds understanding
2. you can stick to the keyboard
3. build up muscle memory
4. Automation

# Using the Shell
- what directory is this? 
- moving around 
- what is in this dir? 
- what size are these things
- getting help
- being super
- do it again
- do it again but super

???
```bash
BE IN ~/dec16_talk

pwd
ls
cd react-express-example 
cd ..

cd ~/dev/talks/cli-basics 
cd -

ls
man 
moving around a bit

sudo

UP ARROW

sudo !!

```

---

# `ctrl` - some short cuts

`ctrl c` : SIGINT / kill

`ctrl z` : pause the fg -> fg and bg

???
start a ping
ctrl c

start a npm server
ctrl z
bg 
jobs
fg
kill

---

# git things 

???
hypothentical:
cd ~/dev/talks/cli-basics

I have the project I am working on 
and I being asked to quickly find and
fix a bug that just happend. 

First I want to make sure I have the
most recent version of develop branch

git checkout develop
git fetch --all // unnessiary but it makes me feel better
git pull

what if I dont believe it thou?
git log
here is the SHA hash of the commit
it matches what bit bucket reports too

This is a really active repo
many things have changed since the last deployment
and FOR THE HYPOTHETICAL lets say its really hard
to narrow down what part of the app is buggy

lets look back one commit
git diff head~1

oh wow that diff is too big
what files chnaged
git diff head~1 --name-only

okay I am pretty sure sure file A is my 
problem lets check it out from main into dev

git checkout main path/to/fileA.txt

Okay that is mostly fixed but I need to 
commit that file into develop

first letme check what things are 
git status

cool its just that file and I trust 
that my changes on it are good

git add . && git commit

WHICH BRINGS US TO VIM
lets yank the branch name 
yw
put that 
i my commit messsage
:wq
