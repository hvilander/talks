# CLI - _why do I care_? 
 by Harold Vilander

???
I found this topic in the backlog, and I love the CLI.

So I thought it was a good one for me to pick up.
I also recognize that not every one needs, wants or cares about CLI skils
---

# Hello CLI
some things to get out of the way:
1. Not exhaustive
2. Correct me!
3. Target Audience: Bash / zsh

???
A while back apple
most commands are the same
I dont think I am messing up bash users

---

# What? 

- Why you might care
- Getting around using the terminal
- Process management
- git examples
- vim

???
- WHY?
1. make an argument for the CLI
  a. for me, better understanding 
  b. 
- Make an argument for learning more CLI
- by More, I expect that everyone knows a bit to a lot
- I expect a lot of difference in familiarity so
 for give me covering the basics


---
# CL-WHY
1. build up muscle memory
2. you can stick to the keyboard
3. _FOR ME_ it builds understanding
4. Automation

---

# Using the Shell
- what dir is this? 
- moving around 
- what is in this dir? 
-- options

- getting help
- completion
- history 
- list directories
- options
- common things, . .. -
- sudo
- sudo last

???
pwd
cd
cd ..
cd ../..
cd ~/home dirtory stuff
cd -
ls
ls -lah



---
# `ctrl`-ing processes

`ctrl c` : SIGINT / kill
`ctrl z` : pause the fg -> fg and bg
`ctrl l` : or clear, no you can just type clear

???
start a ping
ctrl c

start a npm server
ctrl z
bg 
jobs
fg
kill

# git things 
```
A -> B -> C -> D
```

`git log`

???
cd into a project
git log
talk about what you are seeing

Example there is some bad behavior in 
2 commits ago

we can check out commits from their hash
we can diff commits comparing two commits refernce
by branch or hash

vim
